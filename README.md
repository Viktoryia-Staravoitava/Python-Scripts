# Python Scripts for Processing Molecular Docking Results
A set of Python helper scripts for automating the processing of molecular docking results generated by AutoDock Vina. These scripts help to prepare the docking output files for further analysis with the BINANA program. After generating all the final files, the scripts also help to compile a summary table containing binding energy values and amino acid environment data.
## Workflow Overview
1. After docking, AutoDock Vina produces one output file per protein-ligand pair. Each file contains multiple docking poses (complexes), depending on the docking settings. These files include only the ligand coordinates.
   - Each such file needs to be split into individual complexes.
   - Next, the protein structure must be added to each of those ligand files to prepare them for BINANA analysis and for subsequent visualization.
2. As a result, we obtain output files from BINANA, which contain information about the amino acid environment around each ligand. We also have complex files that include both the ligand coordinates and binding energy values. These files are processed using a Python script, producing two .txt files. These contain information on: the name of each complex, its binding energy, and the amino acid environment within 2.5 Å and 4 Å.
3. The resulting .txt files can be opened in Excel and converted into tables for further analysis.
